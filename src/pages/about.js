                                The conclusion is that all knowledge{" "}
                                <em>cannot</em> be physical; there must be some
                                non-physical part of consciousness. This
                                essentially disproves physicalism, which is the
                                idea that all conscious states can be reduced to
                                brain states. What results is{" "}
                                <em>epiphenomenalism</em>, the idea that the
                                physcial brain states give rise to conscious
                                states, yet these states have no causal
                                influence on the world.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, epiphenomenalism is nonsensical; it
                                seems obvious that our thoughts, emotions, and
                                feelings have an effect on our behavior. So, how
                                to disprove the knowledge argument?
