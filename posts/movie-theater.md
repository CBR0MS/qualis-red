# The Movie Theater Effect 

There's a peculiar mental phenomenon that I've been thinking about lately. Like most aspects of consciousness, it's hard to explain, but perhaps is best summed up by *that feeling you get when walking outside after a long movie*. 

When you emerge on the sidewalk after a two-and-a-half hour feature, there's a kind of disorienting effect that takes place, a sudden awareness of the world. You notice the time of the day, the state of the street outside, but your mind is lagging. You're still thinking about the movie, but also the world around you. There's a split in attention between what's real and what you've just experienced. Maybe you begin to think about getting something to eat, and now your attention is further split finding a restaurant. Your experience might feel cloudy, like it requires more effort than normal to process what's going on around you. 

These are some of the experiences I've noticed when stepping out of a movie theater. There might be a better way of describing it, but for now I'm encapsulating all this experience into *The Movie Theater Effect*.  

The Movie Theater Effect can be created from activities besides just watching a movie. It can also be generated when focusing on one task or topic for a long time. An example of this variant of the experience might come from getting stuck in a "Wikipedia vortex," where you find yourself clicking from topic to topic on Wikipedia. For me, this is the most common case. I'll see something worth looking up in a reading and pull up the Wiki article for it. I read the page, clicking links to related topics and reading their pages, gradually getting pulled into the Wikipedia vortex. Ninety minutes later, I've managed to move from an article on the Darien Scheme to an article on Satskachewan. I close Wikipedia and trigger the Movie Theater Effect. 

In the case of the Wikipedia vortex, the Movie Theater Effect is  a little less acute. There's a sense of disorientation, and it takes a minute to regain awareness of the context that led to the first Wikipedia search. What was I doing? Oh, yes. It takes another minute to process what just happened. Right, I spent ninety minutes reading Wikipedia articles.

## A possible mechanism behind the Movie Theatre Effect

Given the two examples, how might the Movie Theater Effect begin to be explained? In both cases, the activity preceding the experience was passive: watching or reading (and clicking around). Both involve looking at a screen. Both involve *continuous and uninterrupted attention on one task*. Both involve doing that task for a long period of time, probably a minimum of forty-five minutes or so. Both involve immediately stopping that task and moving to a different, unrelated task. 

The important part seems to be the *attention*; there are plenty of other passive tasks that can be done for a long time and not produce the effect. There's something particular about the fact that it is prompted by an extended period of close attention on one task that is key. This might lead to further requirements, such as the environment being relatively stimulus-free, or the task being engaging enough to encourage full attention. These can both contribute to the kind of selective attention required to produce the effect, and other factors that encourage focused attention would likely be beneficial as well. 

Attention being key to producing the effect also supports the idea that the preceding activity must be passive. An activity such as walking, for example, splits attention between the act of walking and thinking about something unrelated. Even if the act of walking seems automatic, mental resources are still being allocated to ensure that each foot placement is correct, the path ahead is clear, and so on. An example of the fact that activities we think of as being automatic require additional attention is when driving and looking for an unfamiliar destination: often the impulse is to turn down the radio or quiet someone talking. The task of driving *and* looking becomes too attention consuming and the additional task of listening must be stopped. 

When all attention is directed towards one activity—like watching a movie—the potential for the Movie Theater Effect begins to build. One objection might be that all attention *is not really* directed at *watching* the movie; there are other activities that also take place when watching a movie, such as thinking about the characters' relations to each other, or how a particular stunt was filmed. This is true, but these topics are prompted by the attention to the movie and occur as a response to the focus on the movie. They are all movie-related. Topics that are thought about during a movie are usually in response to the movie, and contribute to building up a particular mental state that revolves around the current target of focus. 

Then, the movie ends and you leave the theater. The mental state that has been built up over two-and-a-half hours is disrupted with new stimuli. Most of your attentional resources have been allocated to focus on the movie, and now they must account for different points of focus. You've been experiencing a series of mental states that are all fairly similar to each other and create the cohesive experience of the movie, then there's a change that tweaks this experience very suddenly. 

The Movie Theater Effect is produced due to this sudden change in mental states. The experience that you've had and become used to changes as attention shifts. The new experience is informed by the previous one, which is still consuming attention.

So, having hypothesized the mechanism behind this effect, what evidence is there to suggest it really exists, or perhaps that it clearly does not exist? On this front, I'm not too sure. The Movie Theater Effect might suggest something about mental states and a kind of interpolation between, where our experience is formed somewhat roughly by each state and the states preceding it. This would create a cohesive experience over time, such that insignificant details and changes aren't all processed, saving resources and avoiding sudden disorientating jumps in experience. It would further suggest that since conscious experience is formed by approximation between differing kinds of states, it is therefore not well suited for sudden changes in kinds of states and stimuli. These are all conjectures but interesting to think about as possible concequences of the Movie Theater Effect. 

## A recipe for producing the effect

The easiest method to reproduce this experience is in the name: go see a movie in a movie theater. Stepping out on the sidewalk later, how do you feel? Introspecting is usually hard, but this should be a fairly distinct experience.
