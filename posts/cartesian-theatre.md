# What is the Cartesian Theater?

The show _Black Mirror_ is rife with interesting and novel forms of technology, usually leading to less-than-ideal futures. Though the Cartesian Theatre is not a technology, a system in _Black Mirror_ provides an excellent visualization of what the Theatre is.

In the episode "Black Museum," a technology is introduced that allows people's consciousnesses to be uploaded to another person's brain. The subject becomes a passive observer in the host, able to experience the same sensations as the host but unable to make any physical response.

This is the essence of the Cartesian Theater: you (the subject) experience the world through interpretations of sensory information (the host). Your experience is bounded by the sensory information from the world, so there's no one-to-one mapping between the physical world and your conscious experience. _Black Mirror_ visualizes it best; it is as if there is a little person—a homunculus—in your mind experiencing the world. This little person is you, your own thoughts and internal narrative: it is the voice inside your head.

Further support for this idea might come from the intuition of having an "internal spotlight" for focusing on particular aspects of consciousness. This is one way of describing _introspection_, the examination your own experience of a particular sight or sound. Putting it in terms of the theater analogy, it is as if your experience is projected onto a "screen" for you to examine and analyze.

Of course, there is no little theater and screen in your head, but the idea remains; you interpret some kind of visual and auditory input to create an experience. There must be a kind of neural interpretation of the raw signals collected by your eyes and ears to construct the recognizable experience of reality.

Is this plausible? Let's build an intuition of how it might work.

# Constructing the Cartesian Theater

The cleanest argument in favor of the Cartesian Theater comes from hallucination. A visual hallucination is quite simple to define:

_A visual experience of some P where there is no physical P at the time of experience_

Under this definition, hallucination can cover a wide range of phenomena, most notably dreams and mental imagery. Anytime you visualize something without that object being in front of you would be considered a hallucination.

There's nothing particularly rare about hallucinations either; they can be induced in about thirty seconds in the form of an afterimage. To try it, stare at the black dot in the center of the image below. After thirty seconds, look away from the screen. Blink a few times. What do you see?

The green circles seem to exist even though the physical stimulus is no longer present. So, what is it you're seeing? If you did the task correctly the afterimage should be quite clear.

_Where_ is what you're seeing? You'd likely be inclined to point out at the world somewhere, where the image seems to fall in your visual field. You probably wouldn't point at your eyes, or your head. That's where you should be pointing, though.

A hallucination is an excellent example of a conscious state because it is something clearly _internally generated_; that is, it is a process initiated by brain states, rather than a perceptual stimuli. It might have required external input to create the conditions necessary to produce the hallucination, but the hallucination itself was generated within; _there was no physical stimulus at the time of experience_. So there was an experience you had, but it was the product of an internal process, not an external one.

## The argument for the Cartesian Theatre

Generalizing this case, we find an argument for the Cartesian Theater:

-   There is an _x_ that I experience
-   For me to experience _x_, it must be either physical or an internal image
-   _x_ is not physical
-   There is an internal image that I experience

Put simply, the argument suggests that all experiences of the external world are in reality internal representations. You are not experiencing the physical intensity of light coming from this screen, rather it is an internal representation of that intensity that you interpret to create the experience. The proposition makes sense on a certain level: your brain only has access to signals from your eyes in the form of action potentials, which are themselves not an experience. The experience must be constructed from these signals, as you do not experience the "raw" signals themselves but rather a cohesive, phenomenally rich reality.

Is this a good view of consciousness?

If you're inclined to think that it is, consider comparing the experience of the world generated through the Cartesian Theatre to that of the Matrix.

In the Matrix, your experience is composed of nothing but ones and zeros. This is the ground truth of the world. For someone in the Matrix, the most real the world can get is ones and zeros.

In the Cartesian Theatre, the true nature of the experiential world is action potentials. You become a sort of passive observer, a homunculus trapped in the mind unable to experience "true" reality, constrained to construct experience from the signals your brain receives. Consciousness becomes nothing more than a perpetual hallucination.

# Escaping the Cartesian Theater

Being trapped within a perpetual hallucination certainly doesn't sound like a pleasant view of consciousness. How might we avoid it?

## Dualism, briefly

Entertaining the dualist view, we find it offers no solution to this problem. The _you_ creating experience would be immaterial, so there’s no strong grounds to discount the Cartesian Theater. How an immaterial mind relates to the biological brain is an impossible problem to solve precisely _because_ the mind is proposed to be immaterial. We simply cannot reason about something that has no constraining properties.

Assuming that the brain does have some kind of function (not a particularly controversial claim), where do we draw the line between unconscious processing done on the neural hardware and experience generated in the immaterial part of the mind? If we take the brain to have any kind of function whatsoever, we always end up with the Cartesian Theater; the brain produces something which is used by the immaterial part of the mind to generate conscious experience. _Where_ line between the two is does not matter, as the very fact that there is such a line is reason enough to always have a form of the Cartesian Theatre. If we wish to escape the Cartesian Theater, dualism is not the answer.

## Physicalism

Now let’s take the physicalist view. We take issue with the you—the homunculus—and its relation to phenomenal experience.

If we assume the homunculus to be a physical part of your brain that generates experience, then it must take inputs from the brain. So how does it generate experience? Well, we've established that the way you create experience is through the Cartesian Theatre. So this physical homunculus must generate experience in the same way as you do: with the Cartesian Theater. Signals in, experience out.

So there is a second theater with its own homunculus within your own theater. How does the second homunculus generate experience? The same way.

Now we have a problem. There's an infinite regression of theaters within theaters, a biologically impossible outcome. Hence, the proposition that there is a kind of physical "you" within the brain that generates phenomenal experience is absurd.

Without a homunculus, we are left with a somewhat more essential view of what the Cartesian Theatre is. Daniel Dennett (who coined the term _Cartesian Theatre_) describes this as the view that "there is a crucial finish line or boundary somewhere in the brain, marking a place where the order of arrival equals the order of 'presentation' in experience because what happens there is what you are conscious of..." This proposition is a non-starter. The brain is a massively distributed system running in parallel. There are areas of specialized functionality, but the entire brain is interconnected in such a way as to make the notion that there exist clearly delineated areas responsible for experience nonsensical.

Luckily for those that find the Matrix an unappealing reality, the Cartesian Theater looks to be an inaccurate view of consciousness. Though the argument might seem simplistic and odd when taken apart, this view of consciousness is still quite pervasive. It's probably the notion of an "internal spotlight" that's most persuasive; the visual metaphor just seems so intuitive.
