# Thoughts

This repository contains the source files for my blog, which can be found here. You can also open `index.html` in your browser to see the site.

It's very simple: each post is an html file in the `/content` directory, and there's a [tiny python script](/compiler.py) that can be run to generate an index file.

To udpate the index file, just run `python compiler.py`.
