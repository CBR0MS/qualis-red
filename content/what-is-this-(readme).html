			<h3>What's going on here?</h3>
			<p>
				This is a place where I put random stuff I like or have made.
				There are opinions mostly, and sometimes you might be able to
				find the rare fact if you're into that sort of thing.

				A list of all the posts on this site can be found on
				<a href="/index.html">the index page</a>.

			<h3>I like making websites</h3>
			<p>
				The time is now and web design is complicated and boring. This
				is a website that's made of
				<a href="https://github.com/cbroms/weblog"
					>nothing but HTML files</a
				>. JavaScript is strictly prohibited from this server. Every
				page is going to be different and each is handcrafted to
				whatever <em>perfection</em> means.
